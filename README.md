# GIPHYAPP

Problem: GIPHY's GIF library is the largest in the world. There are almost too many good GIFs to chose from! In order to help users hone their search, I designed a simple app that grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page. The topic of my search was restricted to cartoons and I included an array of some of my favorite animated programs growing up. 

Solution: The user can hit a button populated from the multiple items in the topic array. Each button will grab 10 gif images from the GIPHY API, as well as its rating. The user however is not bound to the array of cartoons. There is a form by which the user can enter his own choice of any topic and search the GIPHY GIF library for ten results that match the title submitted.

The app was implemented using: HTML,CSS Bootstrap, JavaScript to make the page dynamic jQuery for Dom Manipulation and
AJAX for API GET requests.
